    <h2>Here is her life story</h2>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1883:</b> Born in Saumur</li>
      <li><b>1893 - 1912:</b> Worked briefly as a shopgirl and, few years as a cafe singer.</li>
 <li><b>1913:</b> She became associated with a few wealthy men and, with financial assistance from one of them, Arthur (“Boy”) Capel, opened a tiny millinery shop in Deauville, France, where she also sold simple sportswear, such as jersey sweaters.</li>
  <li><b>1918:</b> Her original use of jersey fabric to create a “poor girl” look had attracted the attention of influential wealthy women seeking relief from the prevalent corseted styles. She stated that “luxury must be comfortable, otherwise it is not luxury,”</li>
 <li><b>1920:</b> The Chanel industries were reportedly worth millions and employed more than 2,000 people, not only in her couture house but also in a perfume laboratory, a textile mill, and a jewelry workshop.</li>

<li><b>1921:</b> She alongside Ernst Beaux, one of the most talented perfume creators in France, introduced Chanel No. 5, the phenomenally successful perfume. It has been said that the perfume got its name from the series of scents that Beaux created for Chanel to sample—she chose the fifth. Chanel was the first major fashion designer to introduce a perfume and that she replaced the typical perfume packaging with a simple and sleek bottle also added to the scent’s success.</li> 
<li><b>1922:</b> She partnered with businessmen Théophile Bader of the Galeries Lafayette department store and Pierre Wertheimer of the Bourjois cosmetics company, who both agreed to help her produce more of her fragrance and to market it in exchange for a share of the profits. After signing a contract wherein she received only 10 percent of the royalties, Chanel enacted a series of lawsuits in the ensuing decades to regain control of her signature fragrance. Although she was never able to renegotiate the terms of her contract to increase her royalties, Chanel nonetheless made a considerable profit from the perfume.</li>

<li><b>1939:</b> Chanel closed her couture house with the outbreak of World War II. Her associations with a German diplomat during the Nazi occupation tainted her reputation.</li>
<li><b>1954</b> She returned to fashion and introduced her highly copied suit design: a collarless, braid-trimmed cardigan jacket with a graceful skirt. She also introduced bell-bottomed pants and other innovations while always retaining a clean classic look.</li>
<li><b>1970:</b> Her sensational love affairs—continued to inspire numerous biographical books, films, and plays, including Broadway musical Coco starring Katharine Hepburn.</li>
<li><b>1971:</b> At the age of 88 she died.</li> 
 <li><b>1983-2019:</b> Chanel’s couture house was led by a series of designers, with Karl Lagerfeld’s tenure being the longest and most influential.</li>
